# es-new-to-current-convert
Using a locally installed babel, converts files and directories of .js/.es6 files to es5 spec .js files.

## To "Install"

1. Navigate to the cloned folder (this means you clone first)
2. Locally initialize the npm package.
3. Package.json defines the bin command as "esconvert", but you can rename it to whatever you want.

Myself
And the lovely folks that made "shelljs", "command-line-args", and "babel-core".

I know it's not much, but it's a start to something useful.
